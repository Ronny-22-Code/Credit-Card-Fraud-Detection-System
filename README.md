# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System
The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. This model is then used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not.

The aim of this project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions. We have applied the most proficient of machine learning algorithms that will be able to discern fraudulent cases from non-fraudulent. The algorithm which we have applied is so proficient that it is capable of detecting fraudulent cases with an accuracy rate of 99.74%. By the end of this machine learning project, you will learn how to implement the appropriate machine learning algorithm which is to perform classification explicitly.
